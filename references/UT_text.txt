The Long Battle#Finally Ending...
The RUINS are very&small once you&get used to them.
The barrier was&destroyed^7.
The demon that comes&when people call&its name.
The entire underground&was devoid of hope.
The future had once&again been taken&from us by the&humans.
The human became&very ill.
The human died.
The human souls&would probably just&revolt again.
The human
The humans had&once again taken&everything&from us.
The humans&attacked him&with everything&they had.
The king and&queen had lost&two children&in one night.
The king decided&it was time to&end our&suffering.
The king has six of&them locked away.
The kingdom fell&into despair.
The next day.
The next day.
The person who warned&us about you...
The person who&asked for that SOUL...
The person who&warned me about&you...

Then what are you looking for?
Then,&hold&still.
Then..^1.&One day...
Then^1
There are alternate&universes out there!
There are plenty&of fish in the&sea...
There is a reason&you continue to&destroy it.
There is a reason&you continue to&recreate this world.
There is nothing&left for us here.
There must be a way&to free us from our&prison.
There's a burning&feeling I can't&describe.
There's&no need&to&fight.
There's&still&hope.

They had such a sweet&smile~ and... ahuhu~

They say I have&the voice of a&Siren..^1.
They say even if&you are a hyper-&violent murderer...
They sealed the monsters&underground with a magic&spell^6. \\E0 ^1 %

\\E6* It converts geothermal& energy into magical& electricity^1
\\E6* It feels like they& all really love& you.
\\E6* It stands for RED^1,& 'cause that's the& color of the lights!
\\E6* It stands for& L-evator^1
\\E6* It takes at least& a human soul...

\\E6* They're AMAZINGLY& bad for you!!
