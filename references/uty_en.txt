The Helper-Bot Guidelines:##1.#Every manufactured bot must have#a practical function installed.#A purpose for being:#(Cooking, cleaning,#agriculture, etc).##2.#Bots should have tiers of#emotion to better integrate#into society.#Coding a personality into#each one is recommended.#It makes them more#personable/easy to be around.##3.#All bots are to have a strong#connection with living things: #(Their creators, average monsters,#other bots, etc).#If deprived of this, some may#become easily agitated#and restless.#Others may be unphased.#Depends on the model.##4.#If a bot acts out of line or#malfunctions, they are to be#shut down. Typically, a hard#reset will do the trick.#Termination is a last resort.#If a shutdown isn't possible,#they can be coaxed back to#their normal state.##5.#Absolutely NO bots are allowed#outside the Steamworks at#this time. Until King#ASGORE is ready to begin mass#production, this project is#classified.##6.Most of all, have fun :)####
